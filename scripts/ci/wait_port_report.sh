# sourced by a benchmark script that has [CONTROL_LOG_RECORDS], [hog_ip] and
# [remote_run] in scope.
#
# [control_cli start] returns as soon as a process is spawned, so a process that
# dies during startup is not reported by its launch. The run fails minutes later
# in a readiness wait, where [wait-port.sh] prints only
#
#     Timed out waiting for 10.100.0.105:8040 after 600s
#
# and the script exits 1. Why nothing is listening is in the process's own log,
# which lives on the remote host and is otherwise collected only at the end of
# the run. Replay it here instead, at the point of failure.
